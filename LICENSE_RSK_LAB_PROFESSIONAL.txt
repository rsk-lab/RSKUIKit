PREAMBLE

R.SK Lab Professional License is a modified version of the RPL-1.5
license, which has been modified to allow users to use the licensed
software in projects without open-sourcing them.

LICENSE TERMS

1.0 The R.SK Lab Professional license applies to all entities which
have been granted "professional" status, and lasts for the duration 
of their professional status.

2.0 All terms of the Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL-1.5) still apply,
but with the following modifications:

a. You are NOT required to disclose the projects publicly, which
means that this professional license is perfect for application developers.

b. You are encouraged, but NOT required, to contribute your software
improvements and modifications back to the main repository.
R.SK Lab would appreciate it, and may grant you free professional status
if the contributions are high-quality.
